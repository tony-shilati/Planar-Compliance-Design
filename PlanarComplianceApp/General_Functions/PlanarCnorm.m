% This is the program to obtain the normal form of compliance matrix.% Input:   matrix C at an arbitrary coordinate frame.% Output: compliance matrix Cn at the compliance center (in diagonal block form).        function Cn =PlanarCnorm(C)               t = PlanarCenter(C); % calculate the location of compliance center	        Tr=[1,0,0;		  0,1,0;		  -t(2),t(1),1];  % tranlation transfromation matrix to the compliance center		  	  Cn=Tr'*C*Tr;   % compliance matrix at the center
